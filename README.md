Pepper's Ghost Cyber Pet

the code.py is the meat.  the SVG cut files are in the box.  Audio files are in audio.  gif files are in gif.  in boo-converter is some scripts to convert animated GIFs into the right size and format and then split them apart to recompile into one BMP that the code displays a section of at a time to animate.  Thanks to @james for the demo code.  I had a lot of plans but the code is just a ghost rebrand of his Cuppa for Halloween party.  I had originally planned to play audio but the dorky hiltec board had used the audio output pins so I got an Adafruit audio board and amp.  I loaded that up with some spooky sounds and shipped it.
